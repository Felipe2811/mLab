# mLab: Easy ML for Non-Coders

## Introduction
mLab is an innovative platform designed to make machine learning (ML) accessible to non-coders. Launched in 2019, it provides a user-friendly interface to explore various ML capabilities without the need for programming knowledge. mLab leverages state-of-the-art technologies to allow users to interact with and understand the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) through interactive and visual methods. It's important to note that while mLab was cutting-edge in 2019, the field of AI has rapidly evolved, and today there are even more advanced and visually engaging ways to explore AI capabilities.

## Features
mLab offers a range of features that demonstrate the power of machine learning in processing and analyzing visual data:

- **Classify**: Utilizes classic image classification techniques with ImageNET data and neural networks (NN) to identify objects within images.
- **Video Classify**: Extends the classification capabilities to live camera inputs, allowing real-time object detection and classification.
- **Doodle Classify**: A fun and interactive feature that classifies user-drawn sketches using SketchRNN and DoodleNET.
- **Pose**: Employs PoseNET, along with p5.js and p5.scribble.js libraries, to predict and display human poses in real time.
- **Pose No Video**: Provides pose prediction functionality without the need for live camera output, suitable for privacy-conscious users.

## Understanding Machine Learning
mLab serves as a gateway for individuals curious about AI and ML. By interacting with mLab's features, users can get a glimpse of the potential applications of machine learning, from simple object recognition to complex pose estimation. It's a testament to how AI can interpret the world around us, transforming raw data into meaningful insights.

## Evolution of AI Visualization
Since mLab's inception in 2019, the landscape of AI visualization and interaction has greatly evolved. Today, there are more sophisticated tools and methods available that offer deeper insights and more engaging user experiences. mLab stands as an important milestone in making AI more accessible to the general public and continues to inspire further innovations in the field.

## Conclusion
mLab showcases the exciting possibilities of machine learning for those without a technical background.
